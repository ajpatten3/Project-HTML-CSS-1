HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark Up Language, this is the basic language that is used to construct the Web.
In the first lesson we learned how to create opening tags VS closing tags and how this can be referred to as a element.
We also learned about HTML attributes. 
Which contain Images and links. 
They look like <a 
                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">this</a>.</p>HTML is how the text <em>looks.</em>

   <p>
The Web is made up of URL's which are then interlinked by hypertext links.
The web consists of Billions of web pages. 
The web contains images, video, and other forms of media. 
When someone is searching the web the computer sends a HTTP request to a server...... like 
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_media.asp">HTML Multimedia</a>

  <div class="font-description">
    <p>
 Computers don't think by themselves, meaning if I tell it to do something it can't talk back and say "this doesn't seem right". This can lead to problems when writing code since the computer can't determine the correct path.

  There can be multiple layers inside HTML documents. 
  This was really cool to see and work through some examples. 
  The flow seems to get easier once I go through it a few times. 
  A example of this "Tree" would be div - H^2 - span - text. 
  This concept of a <em>"Family Tree"</em> can be thought of as multiple layers of support. If you need help with a topic you can look in this article and that article may have another sub article explaining the process of another step that effects the entire process. 
  <!--- Hopefully that wasn't confusing..I was trying to think of another example besides the family example.-->

    We learned about a new program called Sublime text editor.
    Which is a more advanced editor.

          CSS Style 
        </div>
          <div class="font-description">
     <p>
         CSS style is the color or theme of the blocks in the HTML text. CSS stands for <em>cascading style sheet</em>. Cascading style sheet allows the programmer to change the color and theme of different elements by giving them a "class". By using "class" this gives the elements it's associated with the specified color or theme.

  Avoiding problems: Keeping consistent code is very important to becoming a good programmer. This concept is important because if you don't keep your code consistent then you end up making the same mistake over and over. This can be hard to fix as well since you have to look at every line of code for a different error. Consistency is important for any new concept in order to maintain good fundamental skills. Consistency is used in programming with closing tags and end tags. These are very important to remember if the code is to be proper format. This concept also comes into play with spacing. The issue I ran into was line spacing with the I.D. tag and linking. These are easy problems to fix but are important concepts to remember going forward.

I am still having trouble with structure. I am not for sure if my HTML is structured properly? I am also still getting used to CSS style and tying it together with HTML.
